## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### SwiftUI Best Practices

```swift
// ✅ Good: Small, focused views
struct CardRowView: View {
    let card: CreditCard

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            CardIconView(card: card)
            CardInfoView(card: card)
        }
    }
}

// ❌ Avoid: Large, monolithic views
struct CardRowView: View {
    var body: some View {
        // 200+ lines of code...
    }
}
```

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Types | UpperCamelCase | `CreditCard`, `SpendingCategory` |
| Functions | lowerCamelCase | `calculateReward()`, `fetchCards()` |
| Variables | lowerCamelCase | `selectedCard`, `totalSpending` |
| Constants | lowerCamelCase | `maxCards`, `defaultReward` |

### File Organization

```swift
// MARK: - Properties
// MARK: - Initialization
// MARK: - Body (for Views)
// MARK: - Private Methods
// MARK: - Static Methods
```

## Adding Credit Card Data

Credit card data is managed through the **scraper system** in `Functions/scraper/`.

### Option 1: Add to Existing Scraper

1. Open the appropriate scraper in `Functions/scraper/scrapers/` (e.g., `chase.js`, `amex.js`)
2. Add the card to the `CARDS` array:

```javascript
{
  name: 'Card Name',
  annualFee: 0,
  rewardType: 'cashback',  // 'cashback', 'points', or 'miles'
  network: 'visa',         // 'visa', 'mastercard', 'amex', 'discover'
  baseReward: 1,
  categories: [
    { category: 'dining', multiplier: 3, cap: 1500, capPeriod: 'quarterly' }
  ],
  imageURL: 'https://...',
  imageColor: '#1A1A1A'
}
```

3. Run the scraper and upload:
```bash
cd Functions/scraper
npm run full  # Scrapes all cards and uploads to Firestore
```

### Option 2: Add New Issuer

1. Create a new scraper file in `Functions/scraper/scrapers/`
2. Extend `BaseScraper` class (see existing scrapers for examples)
3. Register it in `Functions/scraper/index.js`

### Verification

- Verify card data accuracy from official issuer websites
- Run `npm run validate` to check data format
- Test in the iOS app after uploading
